# Employee Database Project

## Background
The task involved researching employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s using provided CSV files. The project encompassed three key aspects: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Data Modeling
- Inspected the CSV files and created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) detailing table relationships.
- ERD available in the [EmployeeSQL repository](https://github.com/Fpolus/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/ERD_Table.png).

### 2. Data Engineering
- Designed table schemas for six CSV files, specifying data types, primary keys, and constraints.
- Created the tables in correct order to handle foreign keys.
- SQL schema available in the [schema folder](https://github.com/Fpolus/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/Table_schemata.sql).
- Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

### 3. Data Analysis
- Executed various SQL queries to derive insights from the data.
- Provided answers to specific questions about the employees during that period.
- SQL queries available in the [queries folder](https://github.com/Fpolus/sql-challenge/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/SQL_queries.sql).
- Results of the queries stored in the [results folder](./results/).

## Additional Information
- All tables and queries were created through self-written code without external copying.
- Utilized online resources including:
  - [W3Schools SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
  - [PostgreSQL Tutorial](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/)
  - [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-createtable.html)
  - [PostgreSQL SELECT Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/sql-select.html)
